							Ads and trackers can follow you across the web by creating a unique ID from your browser fingerprint. A browser fingerprint is a collection of data 
							that may include some of the following items below:</p> <ol class="mt-4"><li class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold text-primary">IP (Internet Protocol) Address</span> <div class="mt-1">An IP address is a string of numbers that are like a street address for the Internet. For example, 
									<strong>74.125.65.91</strong> is an IP address that belongs to Google. A website can use these numbers to
									get a rough estimate of your geographic location.</div></li> <li class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold text-primary">User Agent</span> <div class="mt-1">A user agent is a string of text that lets a website know what device is making a request. For example, 
									<strong>Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 8.1.0; SM-T580) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.157 Safari/537.36</strong>
									is a user agent that tells a website that the page is being loaded from a &quot;Samsung Galaxy Tab A&quot;
									tablet running Chrome 74 on Android 8.1. A website can use this to redirect you to a mobile version of their site.</div></li> <li class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold text-primary">Fonts</span> <div class="mt-1">Windows, macOS, Android, etc are bundled with different fonts. A website can check to see which fonts are installed on your computer.
									This information can contribute to a fingerprint that may be used to identify devices and people in a shared location.</div></li> <li class="mb-4"><span class="font-semibold text-primary">Screen Resolution</span> <div class="mt-1">Your device/monitor screen data leaks the screen resolution that you&#39;re using and if you&#39;re using multiple monitors. This information
									can contribute to a fingerprint that may be used to identify devices and people in a shared location.</div></li></ol></div></div> <div id="q3" class="mb-8 leading-tight"><h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Why is Chameleon not available for Chrome/Chrome-based browsers?</h2> <p class="text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed md:w-4/5">Chameleon uses some features that are only available in Firefox. If you care about your privacy you
						<strong>should not</strong> use Google Chrome. If you can, please use Firefox or Safari as your primary
						browser. Yes, there are some websites that only work in Chrome. Fortunately, there are Chrome-based alternatives
						that you can use: <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brave</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ungoogled Chromium</a>.</p></div> <div id="q4" class="mb-8 leading-tight"><h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Is Chameleon enough to protect my privacy online?</h2> <p class="text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed md:w-4/5">No.
						<br/><br/>
						There are several other Firefox extensions that you should use in addition to
						Chameleon and privacy practices you should follow.
						For a list of recommened extensions, check the <a href="${l}/wiki/recommended-extensions">Recommended Extensions</a> page.</p></div> <div id="q5" class="mb-8 leading-tight"><h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Does Chameleon make me anonymous online?</h2> <p class="text-xl mb-4 leading-relaxed md:w-4/5">No.
						<br/><br/>
						Spoofing your browser profile does not make you anonymous online. 
						In case you&#39;re wondering, &quot;private&quot; windows do not make you anonymous either.
						Chameleon&#39;s purpose is to minimize the effectiveness of tracking on the web. If you&#39;re worried about
