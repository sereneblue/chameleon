      The IP Rule Editor can be used to automatically assign a language and timezone
      to an IP address when Firefox is started when you select "IP" as the option
      for timezone or language spoofing.
      <br>
      <br>
      After you've added rules, you may want to click the "Reload IP info" button to update your spoofed profile.

      In v0.20.0, the format for IP ranges was changed. Instead of CIDR notation, the IP range is now specified
      as [Start IP Range]-[End IP Range]. For example, <strong>1.1.1.1-2.2.2.2</strong> is valid input for an IP range.
