        Chameleon can be installed from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/chameleon-ext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMO</a>
        or the <a href="/chameleon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">home page</a>, however, this version comes with a limitation: 
        options that require the privacy permission can not be changed. This is caused by an issue with the privacy permission; it can not be 
        requested by the user on Firefox pre-v75. As of v0.21.2, Chameleon now has a special build for users that require this functionality.

      <p>
        Visit <a href="https://github.com/sereneblue/chameleon/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a> to grab the latest legacy build.
        There are no other functional differences between this build and the one listed on AMO. This build will replace your existing Chameleon install and will also receive updates.
